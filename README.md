## Introduction

In this repository, we've conceptualized the iPhone 14 with a groundbreaking design element called the "Dynamic Island." This concept explores the idea of a customizable section on the back of the iPhone that can change its appearance and functionality based on user preferences and app interactions.

## Features

### Dynamic Island

The core feature of this project is the Dynamic Island, a unique design element that provides the following capabilities:

- **Customizable Appearance**: Users can change the look of the Dynamic Island to match their style or mood using an intuitive app.
- **App Integration**: Dynamic Island adapts to the active app, displaying relevant information, icons, or animations.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Users receive tactile feedback through vibrations and visual cues when interacting with the Dynamic Island.

### Interactive Demo
